There&rsquo;s no point in being loyal to your car insurance provider unless they&rsquo;re giving you the best deal possible - so when your policy is due for renewal, always take the time to shop around to see if you can find a better deal. And remember it&rsquo;s always cheaper to pay in one go, if you can, rather than monthly.\"",
